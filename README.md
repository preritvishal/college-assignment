# college-assignment
This website is a small interactive quiz about xhtml


The author of this project may not be brightest in web-dev, or front-end designing,

but has honesty, dedication and learning attitude as counterweight.


Hence, This project is made with collaboration of:

	> VS Code intellisense

	> Github co-pilot

	> Some random site which provide free css design

	> Some UI/UX instagram pages I followed for such just-in-case scenario

	> FOSS icon and wallpaper sites such as icon8 and unsplash

	> Lets-try-this-and-hope-it-works

	> Hopes and prayers


To add anything to gitignore, simply add "depricated-" before it's file name, it will not be tracked

Any page name starting with test will also not be tracked, as they will only be used by programmer from testing small pieces of code.
